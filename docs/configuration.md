# Configuration

birdclaw reads configuration from these layers:

1. **Command flags** — for example `--account`, `--mode`, and `--transport`.
2. **Environment variables** — global paths plus feature-specific overrides.
3. **User config** — `~/.birdclaw/config.json`, or the file selected by `BIRDCLAW_CONFIG`.

## Storage root

The default root is `~/.birdclaw`. It holds:

```text
~/.birdclaw/
  birdclaw.sqlite              # canonical local truth
  config.json                  # user config
  media/                       # original media cache
  media/thumbs/avatars/        # avatar cache
  audit/                       # JSONL audit logs (e.g. bookmarks-sync.jsonl)
  logs/                        # launchd stdout/stderr
  locks/                       # job lock files
```

Override the root for one process:

```bash
export BIRDCLAW_HOME=/path/to/custom/root
```

The Playwright test home is `.playwright-home` in the repo, which is why CI never touches the production root.

## Config file

`~/.birdclaw/config.json` controls live transport, scheduled jobs, mention sourcing, and backup auto-sync.

```json
{
	"actions": {
		"transport": "auto"
	},
	"mentions": {
		"dataSource": "bird",
		"birdCommand": "/Users/steipete/Projects/bird/bird"
	},
	"backup": {
		"repoPath": "/Users/steipete/Projects/backup-birdclaw",
		"remote": "https://github.com/steipete/backup-birdclaw.git",
		"autoSync": true,
		"staleAfterSeconds": 900
	}
}
```

### `actions.transport`

- `auto` — try `bird` first for block/unblock/mute, then fall back to verified `xurl`
- `bird` — force `bird`
- `xurl` — force `xurl`; verifies through `bird status` before mutating SQLite

Twitter still rejects pure OAuth2 block writes for many accounts, so `auto` is the safe default.

### `mentions.dataSource`

- `birdclaw` — local cache only
- `bird` — refresh through `bird mentions --json`, normalize, cache in SQLite
- `xurl` — refresh through `xurl mentions`, cache the response shape

`mentions.birdCommand` overrides the `bird` binary path when you want to point at a non-`PATH` build.

### `backup.*`

See [Backup](backup.md). When `autoSync` is enabled, read commands pull + merge from Git only when the last check is stale, and data-changing commands push back automatically. Set `BIRDCLAW_BACKUP_AUTO_SYNC=0` to disable for one process.

| `BIRDCLAW_HOST`                | Host interface for the production `birdclaw serve` listener; defaults to `127.0.0.1`                                                                 |

| `BIRDCLAW_BACKUP_AUTO_SYNC`    | Set to `0` to disable auto-sync for one process                                                                                                      |

| `BIRDCLAW_AI_PROVIDER`         | Set to `gemini` to use Gemini for shared analysis/digest/discussion flows instead of OpenAI                                                          |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY`               | Gemini API key used when `BIRDCLAW_AI_PROVIDER=gemini`                                                                                               |

| `BIRDCLAW_AI_MODEL`            | Override the analysis model (`gpt-5.5` for OpenAI, `gemini-3.5-flash` for Gemini by default)                                                         |

`BIRDCLAW_DISABLE_LIVE_WRITES=1` is set automatically in CI and Playwright runs so test code can never publish a tweet, send a DM, or block an account.

## AI provider

OpenAI remains the default for AI summaries:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

Use Gemini for shared Markdown+JSON analysis flows:

```bash
export BIRDCLAW_AI_PROVIDER=gemini
export GEMINI_API_KEY="..."
export BIRDCLAW_AI_MODEL=gemini-3.5-flash
```

This covers the shared profile analysis, discussion, and digest runtime. Legacy
inbox-scoring helpers still require `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## Multi-account

birdclaw was built around multiple accounts in a single shared database from day one. Pass `--account <id>` on commands that support account selection, including moderation, mentions, DMs, and live sync commands.

Per-account state — cursors, transport preferences, last-sync watermarks, OpenAI score caches — lives inside the same `birdclaw.sqlite`. There is no per-account directory tree.

## Transport selection

There is no single global transport order:

- Archive imports and local reads need no live transport.
- Sync commands select their source with `--mode`; supported modes and defaults vary by command.
- Mentions export resolves its data source separately.
- Moderation writes use command `--transport`, then `BIRDCLAW_ACTIONS_TRANSPORT`, then `actions.transport`, then `auto`.

For moderation, `auto` tries bird first and falls back to xurl. Persist that choice with `birdclaw auth use <auto|bird|xurl>`.

## Disabling live writes

For dry runs, demos, or development against a fresh archive:

```bash
export BIRDCLAW_DISABLE_LIVE_WRITES=1
birdclaw compose post "this will not actually post"
birdclaw blocks add @someone --account acct_primary
```

Both commands record the intent locally where applicable but skip every transport call. Tests and CI rely on this exact mechanism.
